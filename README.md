For all websites and links I used, I am still able to continue from where I left off. I have yet to delete my Twitter account so I am still able log-in under my username (screenshot 10) to make any tweets under my profile, despite me not publishing one since 2:15PM on Wednesday. The same can be said for my Tracery. I have included both the link and my progress to this repo, so I am still able to log-in whenever is necessary to make any new changes or idea to my webpage. For know, it remains exactly the way I left it at 2:07:51 PM EST on Wednesday, October 5th. My Twine page, which was my favourite out of all the websites and mediums we used for this Interstitial also has both screencaps and a weblink included inside this repo. I was actually able to get so much progress completed throughout our classtime on Monday that you could play multplie scenarios throughout my webpage. 
Throughout my work, I made sure to always be thinking about the importance of the readings that were assigned to us about 
Throughout the work I made during these two sessions, I feel I made a model importance and creations based on what Dr. Graham instrcuted us to create. I understand he is someone who knows the importance of digital humanities and the historical components that go along with them. Therefore, I took his instructions to heart when he mentioned that we should "take a Wikipedia article for some historic event that captures your imagination. We’ll storyboard and consider how to express the story via these two different platforms (taking into account what we’ve discussed in prior meetings)".1 I included the Battle of Wake Island in my idea for my Twine design, as I relaized just how much information and choices I could make with an event like that. Making something as vital to someone deciding to fight or retreat, to something as trviial to deciding whether to fight in a submarine or a plane are all features I decided to inculde my project when I was drafting it. I find this to be an excellent definition of what public history is
