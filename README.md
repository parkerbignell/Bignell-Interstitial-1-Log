  For all websites and links I used, I am still able to continue from where I left off on Wednesday. I have yet to delete my Twitter account so I am still able log-in under my username (see Screenshot 10) to make any tweets under my profile, despite me not publishing one since 2:15PM on Wednesday. The same can be said for my Tracery. I have included both the link and my progress to this repo, so I am still able to log-in whenever it is necessary to make any recent changes or idea to my webpage. For now, it remains exactly the way I left it at 2:07:51 PM EST on Wednesday, October 5th. My Twine page, which was my favourite out of all the websites and mediums we used for this Interstitial has both screencaps and a weblink included inside this repo. I am glad I was able to complete so much progress throughout our class time on Monday so that one could play with the multiple scenarios throughout my webpage. 
  
  Throughout my work, I made sure to always be thinking about the importance of the readings that were assigned to us for topics pertaining to the subject matter of the course. Thus, I enabled myself to develop an accurate framework for the direction I wanted my finished projects to head towards. As I knew when I enrolled in this course, the subject matter we would touch on would be vastly different than those discussed in traditional or museum courses. However, several aspects of the lectures, readings and sessions that have corresponded in this class thus far, including the Interstitials, are able to develop innovative ways of looking at our world around us to find new ways to connect to our past. Sylaiou and Dafiotis say it best in their writing of: 
  
> "in the world of marketing, cultural organisations, such as museums, have realized that the brand and the brandname are not enough. Cultural consumers, museum visitors want stories. Life is about stories and people love stories. So, museums have become storytellers. They transformed their cultural products by attaching additional features, such as storytelling and digital storytelling, that combine educational and entertainment aspects, to make them more appealing and easier to understand. The museum exhibits are not important per se, but because of the stories they can tell, that trigger visitors' imagination and can thereby create unforgettable memories. These stories can reveal human presence behind the objects, make sense of museum exhibits by understanding an exhibit's function and meaning, and help visitors draw links between past and the present. Contemporary museum experience can be enhanced by providing tools for different visitor categories to help them create their own interpretations and share them with others. The digitization of museums offers the possibility of a parallel virtual doppelganger of the original collections".[^1] 
 
  In the circumstances of this classroom, we as the students were primarily the ones assigned to develop our own ways of alternative thinking, but that is what people visiting museums should be doing. As someone who spent last summer working inside the Nepean Museum, I learned how crucial it was that everyone who wished to immerse themselves amongst the various exhibits, collections and materials we had available should be able to do so, as it helped connect them to the past of the Nepean area, as well to create some new memories. Utilizing objects that might come across as having little to no significance was important in driving this message home to those folks. Even though Twitter Bots and Tracery designs may come across as bizarre examples of media and web resources, they are nevertheless perfect examples of these resources. The idea to post whatever ideas one conjures up in their mind, as well as to design their own hypothetical spins on historical scenarios, are all examples of what Sylaiou and Dafiotis are trying to tell readers; history does not have to be inside a physical room.[^2] It can be done online, through alternative means or even using fake social media accounts.
  
  Throughout the work I did across these two sessions, I believe I made models capturing the importance of the learning outcomes and goals creations Dr. Graham set out for this course. I understand he is someone who knows the importance of digital humanities and the historical components that accompany with them. Therefore, I took his instructions to heart when he mentioned that we should "take a Wikipedia article for some historic event that captures your imagination. We’ll storyboard and consider how to express the story via these two different platforms (taking into account what we’ve discussed in prior meetings)".[^3] 
  
  I included the Battle of Wake Island in my idea for my Twine design, as I realized just how much information and choices I could make with an event like that. Making something as vital to someone deciding to fight or retreat to something as trivial to deciding whether to fight in a submarine or a plane are all features I decided to include in my project when I was drafting it. I find this to be an excellent definition of what public history is as there is much more to history than just readings, worksheets and the occasional documentary film. In a way, this Interstitial summarizes the very essence of this course, as it encourages students such as myself to challenge their conventual methods of learning with new broader ideas that put learning outcomes in their own hands. The thought that someone can type into a web browser a link that can transport them to famous historical events demonstrates just how far and sophistaced the medium of public history has come. I believe Sylaiou and Dafiotis said it best: "the narrative of the museum exhibition involves interactive components and is linked with digital content, like images, sounds and videos, to produce a multimedia experience that allows the active participation of the museum visitor. Nowadays, ICT provide tools, such as digital storytelling, that deliver complex and interactive information in VMs, permitting onsite and online experiences and start conversation with the visitors. Museums can provide meaning to the ways that people interact with technology, use various content delivery methods, such as Web browsers, tablets, smartphones, provide interactive storytelling experiences not only for individuals, but also for groups and use multiple layers to present a story".[^4] 
  
  If there is any denial that the subject matter of what took place during this past week's Interstitial was confusing/incorrect, we know we have the good words of Sylaiou and Dafiotis to back up our argument. It is so astounding we got to read an argument about how these types of technology and mediums are meant work and then act on them to convey its true meaning. I am sure that if one of the editors of that book, such as Fotis Liarokapis, were to witness what we did this past week, I am sure they would believe they would be responsible for bringing about the next generation of historians through new forms of interpretation.
