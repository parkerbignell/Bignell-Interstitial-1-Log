For all websites and links I used, I am still able to continue from where I left off. I have yet to delete my Twitter account so I am still able log-in under my username (screenshot 10) to make any tweets under my profile, despite me not publishing one since 2:15PM on Wednesday. The same can be said for my Tracery. I have included both the link and my progress to this repo, so I am still able to log-in whenever is necessary to make any new changes or idea to my webpage. For know, it remains exactly the way I left it at 2:07:51 PM EST on Wednesday, October 5th. My Twine page, which was my favourite out of all the websites and mediums we used for this Interstitial also has both screencaps and a weblink included inside this repo. I was actually able to get so much progress completed throughout our classtime on Monday that you could play multplie scenarios throughout my webpage. 
Throughout my work, I made sure to always be thinking about the importance of the readings that were assigned to us for topics pertaining to the subject matter of the course. That way, I enabled myself to develop an accurrate framework for the direction I wanted my finished projects to go in. As I knew when I enrolled in this course, the subject matter we would touch on would be vastly different than those discussed in traditional or museum courses. However, several apsects of the lectures and sessions that have coresspoded in this class thus far, including the Interstitials, are able to develop new and innovative ways of looking at our world around us in order to find new ways to connect to our past. Sylaiou and Dafiotis say it best in their writing of: "in the world of marketing, cultural organisations, such as museums, have realized that the brand and the brandname are not enough. Cultural consumers, museum visitors want stories. Life is about stories and people love stories. So, museums have become storytellers. They transformed their cultural products by attaching additional features, such as storytelling and digital storytelling, that combine educational and entertainment aspects, so as to make them more appealing and easier to understand. The museum exhibits are not important per se, but because of the stories they can tell, that trigger visitors' imagination and can thereby create unforgettable memories. These stories can reveal human presence behind the objects, make sense of museum exhibits by understanding an exhibit's function and meaning, and help visitors draw links between past and the present. Contemporary museum experience can be enhanced by providing tools for different visitor categories to help them create their own interpretations and share them with others. The digitization of museums offers the possibility of a parallel virtual doppel-ganger of the original collections".1
Throughout the work I made during these two sessions, I feel I made a model importance and creations based on what Dr. Graham instrcuted us to create. I understand he is someone who knows the importance of digital humanities and the historical components that go along with them. Therefore, I took his instructions to heart when he mentioned that we should "take a Wikipedia article for some historic event that captures your imagination. We’ll storyboard and consider how to express the story via these two different platforms (taking into account what we’ve discussed in prior meetings)".1 I included the Battle of Wake Island in my idea for my Twine design, as I relaized just how much information and choices I could make with an event like that. Making something as vital to someone deciding to fight or retreat, to something as trviial to deciding whether to fight in a submarine or a plane are all features I decided to include my project when I was drafting it. I find this to be an excellent definition of what public history is as there is much more to history than just readings, worksheets and the occassional documentary film. In a way, this Interstitial summarizes the very essence of this course, as it encourages students such as myself to challange their convential methods of learning with new broader ideas that put learning outcomes in their own hands. The thought that someone can type into a web broswer a link that can transport them to famous historical events demonstrates just how far and sophistaced the meduim of public history has come. I believe Sylaiou and Dafiotis said it best: "the narrative of the museum exhibition involves interactive components and is linked with digital content, like images, sounds and videos, to produce a multimedia experience that allows the active participation of the museum visitor. Nowadays, ICT provide tools, such as digital storytelling, that deliver complex and interactive information in VMs, permitting onsite and online experiences and start conversation with the visitors. Museums can provide meaning to the ways that people interact with technology, use various content delivery methods, such as Web browsers, tablets, smartphones, provide interactive storytelling experiences not only for individuals, but also for groups and use multiple layers to present a story".2 If there is any denial that the subject matter of what took place during this past week's Interstitial was confusing/incorrect, we know we have the good words of Sylaiou and Dafiotis to back up our argument. It is so interesting that we actually get to read an argument about this type of technology and medium is meant work and then act it to convey its meaning. I am sure that if one of the editors of that book, such as Fotis Liarokapis, were to witness what we did, I am sure they would bleeive they would be repsonislbe for bringing about the next generation of historians through new forms of interpretation.
